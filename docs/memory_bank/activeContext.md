     - Storytelling and introduction meeting
   - Remove all upcoming/recurring event language

3. **Homepage Content Audit** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

### Next Phase Preview: Blog CMS System
- Committee's #1 request: self-loading blog capability
- Need admin interface for content management
- Requires Supabase backend integration

## Recent Client Feedback
- "Wording is everything" - content accuracy is critical
- Mission, Values, Aspirations document provided
- Strong emphasis on separating from hospice identity

## Current Challenges

- No backend/CMS system for content management
- Need to completely reframe organizational identity

## Blockers

- Committee review required after Phase 1 completion

## Success Criteria for Current Phase
- All hospice references removed
- Accurate mission/values/aspirations implemented
