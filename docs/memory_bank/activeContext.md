# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Content Updates & Corrections

### Immediate Priorities (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. **About Page Overhaul** - CRITICAL
   - Extract Mission, Values, Aspirations from CNG.docx.pdf document
   - Remove "What We Do" section completely
   - Remove "How We Can Help" section completely
   - Add community grants logo
   - Zero hospice references remain

2. **Events Page Restructure** - HIGH
   - Replace fictional future events with actual past events:
     - Advance Care Planning day (brought in author)
     - Youngsters of Yore presentation
     - Storytelling and introduction meeting
   - Remove all upcoming/recurring event language
   - Clarify events are organized as needed, not regularly scheduled

3. **Homepage Content Audit** - MEDIUM
   - Remove service provider language throughout site
   - Eliminate all hospice references
   - Focus on community connection and storytelling messaging
   - Emphasize facilitator role, not service provider

### Phase 2 Preview: Blog CMS System
- Committee's #1 request: self-loading blog capability
- Need Supabase integration before implementation
- Admin interface for content management
- Rich text editor and media management

## Recent Progress
- âœ… Memory Bank created with 7 comprehensive files
- âœ… Comprehensive ticket.md created using Specif-AI framework (306 lines)
- âœ… Clear implementation strategy defined
- âœ… Technical specifications documented
- ðŸ”„ Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation

## Critical Client Requirements
- "Wording is everything" - content accuracy is paramount
- Mission, Values, Aspirations document (CNG.docx.pdf) provided
- Strong emphasis on separating from hospice identity
- CNG "doesn't really do anything" - they facilitate, don't provide services
- Committee self-management of blog content is #1 priority

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **Content Extraction** (1-2 days)
   - Parse CNG.docx.pdf document
   - Extract exact Mission, Values, Aspirations text
   - Identify all hospice references for removal

2. **About Page Implementation** (1 day)
   - Remove prohibited sections completely
   - Implement new content structure with official text
   - Add community grants logo
   - Test content accuracy

3. **Site-wide Content Audit** (1-2 days)
   - Remove service provider language across all pages
   - Eliminate hospice references everywhere
   - Update positioning to community facilitator

## Blockers & Dependencies
- **Critical**: Need to access and extract content from CNG.docx.pdf
- **Dependency**: Client review required after Phase 1 completion
- **Phase 2 Blocker**: Supabase integration must be activated before CMS implementation
- **Risk**: Content accuracy must be 100% before proceeding to Phase 2
