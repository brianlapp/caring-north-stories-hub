# Memory Bank Instructions

## Purpose
This Memory Bank serves as the central knowledge repository for the Compassionate North Grenville website project. It ensures consistency, maintains context, and guides all development decisions.

## How to Use This Memory Bank

### For AI Agents
1. **Always reference these files first** before making any code changes
2. **Check activeContext.md** to understand current priorities
3. **Verify changes align with projectbrief.md** core principles
4. **Follow patterns established in systemPatterns.md**
5. **Update progress.md** after completing work

### For Developers
1. Read `projectbrief.md` first to understand project fundamentals
2. Review `productContext.md` to understand user needs and constraints
3. Check `activeContext.md` for current work focus
4. Follow `systemPatterns.md` for architecture decisions
5. Reference `techContext.md` for implementation details

## Critical Constraints to Remember

### Content Guidelines
- **NEVER position CNG as a service provider** - they are facilitators
- **NEVER reference hospice** - separate organizations despite member overlap
- **NEVER create fictional events** - use only actual past events
- **ALWAYS emphasize community connection** over direct services

### Technical Guidelines
- **Keep components small and focused** - avoid large files
- **Use TypeScript strictly** - maintain type safety
- **Follow Tailwind CSS patterns** - utility-first approach
- **Implement responsive design** - mobile-first approach

### Development Process
1. **Phase 1**: Content accuracy and corrections
2. **Phase 2**: Blog CMS implementation
3. **Phase 3**: Technical infrastructure
4. **Phase 4**: Content migration and testing

## Key Decision Drivers
- **Committee self-management** - #1 priority for blog system
- **Community focus** - everything serves community connection
- **Authenticity** - accurate representation of organization
- **Simplicity** - avoid over-engineering solutions

## When to Update This Memory Bank
- After completing major phases
- When client provides new requirements
- After architectural decisions
- When discovering new constraints or opportunities

## Memory Bank Maintenance
- Review and update after each development cycle
- Ensure activeContext.md reflects current state
- Update progress.md with completed work
- Add new patterns to systemPatterns.md as they emerge

## Emergency Principles
If ever unsure about a decision:
1. Does it serve community connection?
2. Does it align with CNG as facilitator (not service provider)?
3. Does it avoid hospice associations?
4. Does it enable committee self-management?

If the answer to all four is "yes," proceed. If not, pause and reassess.

## Context Switching
When switching between different aspects of the project:
- **Content Work**: Reference productContext.md and client feedback
- **Technical Work**: Reference systemPatterns.md and techContext.md
- **Planning Work**: Reference activeContext.md and progress.md
- **Architecture Decisions**: Reference all files for comprehensive view

This Memory Bank is a living document that grows with the project. Keep it current, accurate, and comprehensive.
