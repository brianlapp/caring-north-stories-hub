**Compassionate North Grenville** 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Introduction** 

North Grenville is a caring community. Building on this strength, we align ourselves with the international public health palliative care movement known as Compassionate Communities. In these communities talk of illness, advance care planning, dying, caregiving, and grieving is no longer taboo; it is accepted and creates a healthy setting for asking for, offering, and receiving help. Compassionate Community- North Grenville, in consultation with local, regional, national and international leaders and resources created a Charter which sets out nine aspirations for what our community can accomplish in the coming years. It is an evergreen document, that will develop and shift with our growing community. 

**What is Compassion?** 

We respond with a shared humanity and kindness to each person’s pain, distress and need. We look for the things we can do, however small you think they may be, to give comfort and relief. We have time for those we support and work alongside. We do not wait to be asked, because we already care.1 

**What is a Compassionate Community?** 

● Compassionate Communities grow connectedness and compassion, working together, to create a supportive environment for those in need. 

● Compassionate Communities is a practice that openly encourages, supports and celebrates caring for each other, especially at those times associated with life threatening or life limiting illness, chronic disability, being a carer, frailty, 

ageing, dementia, dying and grief. 

● Compassion is the community’s responsibility, that’s me, you, all individuals, families, peers, neighbourhoods, workplaces, schools, health services, government, faith based, voluntary and other organisations and services. 1 

**Why a Compassionate Community?** 

● Compassionate communities help people to live their best lives. 

● Death is not just a medical event, it is a social, relational and spiritual process that involves more than the health services system.2 

● 95% of the care of the dying is done by your family and support network. Less than 5% of total care is provided by health care services.3 

● Compassionate Communities are a resource for fostering public awareness of palliative care. 4
