<p>My wife of 55 years passed away at the very end of December 2023. It left me in quite a funk and I had a rough time for the next while. In February of last year I saw an article in The Times about an initial meeting of a new group that was being established for men in the last quarter of their lives called North Grenville Men''s Shed.</p>

<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>Our first meeting was on the Kemptville campus and from there we had many meetings in Oxford Mills at the old school. We have since been able to graduate to the old Salvation Army building on the corner of Oxford Street and Prescott Street.</p>

<p>I found quick companionship with a bunch of guys around my same age. As the group has matured it has become more community oriented and the guys have been there to help the Salvation Army move food from a large trailer to the food bank in town.</p>

<h2>Community Connection</h2>
<p>When Shalom Small homes began their first project to build four small homes, a few of the guys who had time and expertise gave time to help build the homes. When the new Home Hardware building supply store opened up they called for help to stock shelves and a number of the Men''s Shed guys stepped up and made a quick job of it. One of our guys is now helping at the Youth Centre across the street to make small repairs to their building. Young people can be hard on the equipment.</p>

<h2>A God Send</h2>
<p>Being a part of this great group of men has been a god send for me at a time when I needed the companionship. I am delighted to have been a member of this compassionate group of guys over the last year and four months.</p>
